# Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using C and OpenCL

This project demonstrates in wich cases GPU is better then CPU. For that purposes I used diffrent Dijkstra's algorithm implementations.

## Required

1. clang and clang++ compiler
2. cmake
3. OpenCL
4. bash
5. Linux

## How to build this project

1. Download it

``` bash
git clone ...
```

2. Move to project directory

For example:
``` bash
cd ~/.../Dijkstra_OpenCL_implementation
```

3. Build it

``` bash
mkdir build
cmake -S src -B build
```

## How to run some tests
